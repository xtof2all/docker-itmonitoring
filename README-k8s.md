# Description of Container Images & Deployment YAML
## Splunk UF with logs collection TA: ta-k8s-logs
Splunk UF deployed as a `daemonset` type to collect docker JSON logs. 

Default configuration is to monitor `/var/log/containers/*.log`. It also contains a disabled input for kubernetes advanced audit, `/var/log/kube-apiserver-audit.log`. If you have configured your apiserver for advanced auditting, you can enable the input `[monitor:///var/log/kube-apiserver-audit.log]` in `ta-k8s-logs/default/inputs.conf`. 

New inputs can be added via config map in the yaml or by editing the app and rebuilding the docker container. 

This image does not currently provide collection from journald.

## Splunk UF with metadata collection TA: ta-k8s-meta
Splunk UF configured as a `Deployment` type to collect k8s metadata from API Server from within the k8s cluster.

A very simple collection of bash scripts that connects to the API Server (REST API), to provide a glimpse of what k8s API integration can provide for log and metric enrichment.

The polling of the API defaults to 30 seconds but is configurable in `ta-k8s-meta/default/inputs.conf` and should be set to a suitable value for your environment. 

**Future** interations to explore using 'watch' instead of 'get'  

**Dependencies**: bash & jq are required in the current scripts, but can easily be modified.   

Commands/output from any k8s client or kubectl itself could easily be integrated here instead of using curl/jq.   

## Deployment YAML: k8s-splunk-full-demo.yaml
Deploys a single instance of Splunk Enterprise in the Kubernetes cluster with the k8s demo app pre-configured. 

The k8s app currently configures an index called k8s that is hardcoded into the dashboards for simplicity. 

**Future** iteration may update the dashboard (overview.xml),  with macros to allow configuration of different indexes.

The app currently contains props/transform configurations:
* sourcetype=kubernetes - index docker JSON driver logs in JSON format or by "unwrapping" the JSON from your stderr/stdout logs and using a linebreaker to provide multiline logging support.
* sourcetype=k8s:api:* - sourcetypes for the API metadata

The exact configuration for your environment will vary greatly on your logging practices, see `k8s/default/props.conf`. The defaults to using the "unwrapped" JSON logs.  

## Run the k8s app and/or ta-k8s-meta on a Splunk instance outside your k8s cluster

If you would like to send your logs/metadata to a Splunk instance running outside the k8s cluster, simply deploy ta-k8s-logs to your cluster and install the k8s app on your external Splunk instance. 

You may also use ta-k8s-meta outside the cluster, by retrieving your service account token and kubernetes api url using kubectl or by consulting your kubernetes admin documentation, then updating the ta-k8s-meta shell scripts accordingly.

## docker-images
Contains the Dockerfiles to build the 3 new images used e.g.,
1. splunk/universalforwarder:7.2.6-monitor-k8s-logs
2. splunk/universalforwarder:7.2.6-monitor-k8s-meta
3. splunk/splunk:7.2.6-monitor-k8s

# Getting Started
## Create a Secret for your Service Account
You will need to create a docker secret to pull the images for your container trusted registry.
```
kubectl create secret docker-registry yourdockerhubsecret --docker-server=https://index.docker.io/v1/ --docker-username=<dockerhub_username> --docker-password=<dockerhub_password> --docker-email=<dockerhub_email>
```

## Prepare your k8s cluster
You will require a functioning k8s cluster running 1.8+. 

We have tested against 
- Heptio's AWS Quickstart (1.8.4):
https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/heptio-kubernetes/ 
- Minikube on OSX Sierra (1.8.0):
https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases

## Configuration and Deployment
Here are the step-by-step instructions to deploy Splunk Enterprise and the 2 Splunk UFs:
1. Update these parameters in the `k8s-splunk-full-demo.yaml` yaml files
* \<yourdockerhubsecret\> : secret to allow image pulls from a Docker Hub repo

* Splunk Enterprise host - `splunkenterprise`: the Splunk host name used to by the UF to forward logs and metadata. The two Universal Forwarders (UFs) (1 deployed as a `DaemonSet` and the other as a `Deployment` type) require a value for the SPLUNK_FORWARD_SERVER.  If you use the k8s-splunk-full-demo.yaml, the assumption is that you will be sending the data to the instance of Splunk Enterprise created as a `Deployment` type in the yaml. 

2. Build the 3 required images:
* ta-k8s-logs: `docker build -t splunk/universalforwarder:7.2.6-monitor-k8s-logs -f ./docker-images/ta-k8s-logs-image/Dockerfile .`
* ta-k8s-meta: `docker build -t splunk/universalforwarder:7.2.6-monitor-k8s-meta -f ./docker-images/ta-k8s-meta-image/Dockerfile .`
* k8s: `docker build -t splunk/splunk:7.2.6-monitor-k8s -f ./docker-images/enterprise-k8s/Dockerfile .`

3. Publish the 3 images to the trusted registery of your choice, e.g., `docker push splunk/universalforwarder:7.2.6-monitor-k8s-meta`, `docker push splunk/universalforwarder:7.2.6-monitor-k8s-logs`, `docker push splunk/splunk:7.2.6-monitor-k8s`.

4. Update the 3 images names you created in the `k8s-splunk-full-demo.yaml`.  Search for `image:` and replace the existing images for your own image names (assuming you changed the names).

5. Deploy Splunk Enterprise and the two Splunk UFs: `kubectl create -f k8s-splunk-full-demo.yaml` 

6. Create port forwarding to access Splunk Web UI
* Run the following command: `kubectl get pods`
* Copy the name for the Splunk Enterprise pod and run the following command: `kubectl port-forward <pod_name> 8000:8000`
* Go to the following web URL using your browser: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Note, if you want to deploy the sample app to your own Splunk Enterprise instance / cluster, simply run the following commands to create the SPL file:
* gtar -cvf ./app-k8s.tar ./k8s/
* gzip ./app-k8s.tar
* mv ./app-k8s.tar.gz ./app-k8s.spl
